# Yeonsung
This link will be deleted on 2020.12.31. The new link for this font is https://github.com/woowabros/Yeonsung.git

Yeonsung is a calligraphic font emphasizing serifs, written naively but neatly letter by letter. Therefore, the strokes of consonants and vowels are not equal, giving bright rhythm to the font.
